To get started:
* Download Inkscape v1.0 or above [here](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.1/)
* Matlab is nice to have for this demo, but we can work around it 

By the end of this demo, you'll learn:
1. Why making a beautiful figure for a paper, presentation, or poster is a **good use of your time**
2. What makes a fantastic figure and **common pitfalls** to avoid
3. Where the **standard tools** are that you'll use in Inkscape
4. Why I prefer to **edit my plots in Inkscape** rather than Matlab (or Python) 
5. How to create a **beautiful hybrid figure** with both ilustration and quantative components
